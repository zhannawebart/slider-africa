        description: "The Zanzibar Archipelago, located in the Indian Ocean 15 miles off the coast of Tanzania, is a breathtaking spot to escape from the world. You’ll enjoy clear, turquoise-blue water; shallow sandbars perfect for wading; and many small, nearly deserted islands virtually unvisited by tourists. Explore the World Heritage Site of Stone Town, Zanzibar City’s old quarter. Or just go beach to beach between tiny fishing villages—each one's better than the next."

        description: "The Serengeti is inarguably Tanzania’s best national park when it comes to wildlife; abundant with our planet’s most exotic animals (including elephants, giraffes, leopards, lions and buffalo), a visit to the Serengeti is nothing short of a magical experience. But what the park is undoubtedly best known for is the annual wildebeest migration. Visitors can witness the sound and sight of over six million wildebeest, zebra and gazelle scampering through the open plains in a hurry to find food and grazing, providing one of the most exhilarating game viewing experiences in the whole of Africa."

        description: "At 5,895 m, Kilimanjaro is the highest point in Africa. This volcanic massif stands in splendid isolation above the surrounding plains, with its snowy peak looming over the savannah. The mountain is encircled by mountain forest. Numerous mammals, many of them endangered species, live in the park."
